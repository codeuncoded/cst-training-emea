# This tutorial has two parts- The server side and the client side.

## Server

This tutorial is written in JavaScript using the (Express framework)[https://expressjs.com/]

For the documentation please visit TB guide for (Node)[https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/node/]

You'll need to complete 4 steps to complete this tutorial, and when you do your server will-

1. Generate sessions
2. Generate tokens per session
3. Receive events

Good Luck!

## Client

Please follow this (tutorial)[https://tokbox.com/developer/tutorials/web/basic-video-chat/] with the following changes:

1. Your API_KEY should be hardcoded, and can be retrieved from the dashboard
2. Session and token should be generated using the server you've just built. Use this (article)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/here-is-the-most-popular-ways-to-make-an-http-request-in-javascript-954ce8c95aaa/] for a quick explantation on how to do HTTP requests.
3. In the end you should be able to perform a one participant video session and see yourself.

The skelaton for the tutorial is already in the web_client dir!

Good Luck!
